 		<h2>Career C Language</h2>
         <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie
            in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language 
            to write an operating system.programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is
            mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such
            as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git,
            Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation 
            the process of learning any other programming language. Operating systems 
            and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from
            supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems are examples of such applications.<br>

            <p>He was an American computer scientist. He is best known for creating the C programming 
               language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B
               programming language.[3] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the
               ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from
               President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software
               Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by 
               his username dmr.rogramming language.[3] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the
