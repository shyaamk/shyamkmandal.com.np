 		<h2>Introduction of JavaScript Language</h2>
     <p>
		The C programming language is a general-purpose, operating system-agnostic, 
		and procedural language that supports structured programming and provides
		low-level access to the system memory.<strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong>  invented C language
		in 1972 at AT&T (then called Bell Laboratory), where it was implemented
		in the UNIX system on DEC PDP II. It was also the successor of the B 
		programming language invented by Ken Thompson. C was designed to overcome
		the problems encountered by BASIC, B, and BPCL programming languages. 
		By 1980, C became the most popular language for mainframes, microcomputers,
		 and minicomputers
      </p>
     <br>

     <p>C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is
		mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such
		as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git,
		Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation 
		the process of learning any other programming language. Operating systems 
		and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from
		supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems are examples of such applications</p>
